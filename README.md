# Homework2
You could change the file path of the dataset and run the code on google colab.

What I have done:
1)	Filled the “To-do” session in Homework-2.ipynb. Produced three h5 files with different required X{2%, 4%, 10%}, and I have uploaded those files.

Apply eval.py on them to get the acc and asr:

X= 2%

X= 4%

X= 10%

2)	Draw a table with the accuracy on clean test data and the attack success rate (on backdoored test data) as a function of the fraction of channels pruned (X). (In the report)
